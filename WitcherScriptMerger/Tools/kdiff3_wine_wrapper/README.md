Wrapper script for calling native kdiff3 with fixed paths.

For using this you have to make changes to the registry: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#How_do_I_launch_native_applications_from_a_Windows_application.3F

Only works with files on `Z:\`.

It’s a bash script, the name’s purpose is to trick ScriptMerger into accepting it as a valid file.
